<p>The system tries to better manage the places in the study room.
It  reserves the place in advance. Each student is assigned one place if available otherwise they are put on a “waiting list”.( this way the problem of one student occupying more than one place is resolved.)
       For the occupied places recognize if they are properly used or not, meaning if student occupying the place just left it's things and went away.  In this case notify the student that
his "study session" is ending(if he was away for too long).Also notifies the student on the top of the “waiting list”. Every change should be displayed to better explain the situation for the other students in line.
       The system tries to exploit also the idea of students leaving the place free for a certain amount of time to reclaim it back later.(recognize the student if he comes back or continue the "study session" with the already seated one).In a certain way students become more understanding. Since they won’t use that service for some time they allow someone else to have it.  In this way the study time is efficiently managed!</p>
